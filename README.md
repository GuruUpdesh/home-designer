# Home_designer
Home Designer is an interior design firm that specializes in client communication and automation. Currently, the firm has 100+ clients meaning that our system will need to be capable of handling roughly 50-200 new client records per year. This is assuming some level of growth or stagnation in new client numbers. The website will record clients’ personal and contact information, project information, billing hours, and employee information. The website helps employees, managers, and clients keep a close eye on the time and money spent on projects. The idea is for there to be a single consolidated place for the business to view and manage its operations. The firm is currently working on 800+ projects with about 250 employees. Again this means that our system will need to handle a moderate employee turnover (50 new employees per year).
